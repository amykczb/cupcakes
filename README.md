# Cupcakes & Coding

Cupcakes & Coding is a safe place to talk about your programming struggles. Each week, two people present for 10-15m about something they figured out that week that they're proud of, or showing a tutorial/demo, or my favorite, showing something that they're *stuck* on ("I just can't get my reads to X" or "Why won't ggplot2 do Y?") . The presentation is followed by 15-20m of discussion to solve the problem or improve the solution together. 

All are welcome, regardless of programming experience. 

Yes, there will be cupcakes from La Luna Cupcakes :)

Please add suggested topics to the czbiohub/cupcakes GitHub project page here: https://github.com/czbiohub/cupcakes/projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen 

Email olga.botvinnik@czbiohub.org if you have any questions, comments, or concerns. Also check out the #eng-support Slack channel for day-to-day questions and discussions about computational woes.

We meet weekly on Tuesdays 4-5pm in the Twin Peaks conference room at Biohub.

## Getting started with coding at Biohub

### `codonboarding`

We have some great resources compiled at [czbiohub/codonboarding](https://github.com/czbiohub/codonboarding) for setting up your computer, getting started with the command line, aegea, and git.

### Data Carpentry Lessons

[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) aims to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing skills. This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data management, and task automation. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

We hosted two workshops: Ecology (data organization in spreadsheets, R, [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/)). Even if you missed them, the lessons are so well-written that one could follow them along on their own!

#### Ecology Lesson 2018-04-11 

This workshop uses a tabular ecology dataset from the Portal Project Teaching Database and teaches data cleaning, management, analysis and visualization. There are no pre-requisites, and the materials assume no prior knowledge about the tools. We use a single dataset throughout the workshop to model the data management and analysis workflow that a researcher would use. This workshop was taught with R.

#### Genomics Lesson 

The focus of this workshop is on working with genomics data and data management and analysis for genomics research. It covers data management and analysis for genomics research including: best practices for organization of bioinformatics projects and data, use of command line utilities, use of command line tools to analyze sequence quality and perform variant calling, and connecting to and using cloud computing.
